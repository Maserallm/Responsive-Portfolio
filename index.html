        <p>Hi, my name is Maserall Marcelin and I am an aspiring software engineer. Currently I am
                enrolled in University of Central Florida's Coding Bootcamp as a part-time student and employed by the famed Florida grocer Publix Super Markets, as an inventory control analyst. 
                I've always had a great interest in the world of front-end web design, creating pages for friends and family members but I never had any formal training in this field up until now. I hope to 
                take what I learn in this program these next six months and acheive the most that I can with it.
        </p>
